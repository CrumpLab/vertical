## What is vertical?

`vertical` is an R package and R-studio project template for making it easy to share research assets in the form of a website and/or R package.

For example, wouldn't it be nice if you could do the work you normally do in R, such as run scripts for data-analysis, write your paper (APA papers in papaja), write your slide decks for presenting your work (say in slidy or xaringan), and other things like document your data, and even run behavioral experiments on the web...and then magically have all of that stuff rendered to a website so that you can share everything. This is the idea behind vertical. You do the work in R, and get a research project website that shares everything for free.

Big note: vertical is effectively a wrapper around several existing R packages that combined, make something like vertical easy. So, thanks to all the other R developers for their free and amazing tools.

Learn more about how to use vertical by looking at the getting started article. You can also check out the project template that gets loaded by vertical here [https://github.com/CrumpLab/vertical_template](https://github.com/CrumpLab/vertical_template), and the resulting website that is generated by the template here [https://github.com/CrumpLab/vertical_template](https://crumplab.github.io/vertical_template/).
