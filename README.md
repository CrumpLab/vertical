## Installation

The devtools library is required for installation:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CrumpLab/vertical")
```

## Quick start

```
# initialize new project from console
vertical::vertical_project()

# build the website
vertical::build_vertical()
```

NOTE: after restarting RStudio, you can make a vertical project by choosing File > New Project... in RStudio, and choosing the Vertical Research Project template.

Read the [getting started](https://crumplab.github.io/vertical/articles/vertical.html) tutorial to learn more about using `vertical`. And, watch [vertical tutorials on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDtczbtj66Q4jn-08HaBbz6fAVdlQ3EQm), still in progress adding more as we find time.

## What is vertical?

`vertical` is a workflow for creating, curating, and communicating research assets in psychological science in the form of a website and/or R package. It is effectively a wrapper for suggesting R Markdown templates for creating various psych research assets, and suggesting the R Package standard to curate the assets. `vertical` installs an RStudio project template with the `vertical` workflow structure, and compiles content in a `vertical` project to an R package and pkgdown website for sharing the assets.
