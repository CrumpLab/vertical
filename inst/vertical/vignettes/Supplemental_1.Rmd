```{r setup}
# note if you generate a vignette using use_vignett(), then it will automatically 
# write the line below calling the library with the name of your package
# If you do not intend to use the R package feature, then comment it out, like below

#library(verticaltemplate)
```

This a plain .Rmd file located in the vignettes folder. Any time you add an .Rmd file to that folder, it will be compiled and served to the supplemental materials tab. 

This could be a template for a supplemental material file where you list your supplemental materials, and perhaps conduct additional analyses. Add as many as you want.
