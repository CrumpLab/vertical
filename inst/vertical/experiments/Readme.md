## Store experiment scripts and demos

The experiments folder is a place where you can save and share your experiment scripts. If you have built an experiment that can run in a web-browser, then you can even share a demo of the experiment. 

Currently, this folder contains a zip file of the most recent release of jspsych, a javascript library for running web-based behavioral experiments .

For more information on using jsPysch, check out the jsPsych documentation <https://www.jspsych.org>.
