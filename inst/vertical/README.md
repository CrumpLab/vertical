# Title of your research project

This is the front page of your website, and the readme file that is displayed on your github repository.

Edit this file to display whatever information you want to show on your front page. This is a markdown document, so use markdown syntax. It is also possible to recreate this file as an .Rmd document if you wish. You can do this with pkgdown.
