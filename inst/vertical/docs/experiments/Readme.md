## Store experiment scripts and demos

The experiments folder is a place where you can save and share your experiment scripts. If you have built an experiment that can run in a web-browser, then you can even share a demo of the experiment. 

This example shows a Stroop experiment built using jspysch <https://www.jspsych.org>, a javascript library for running behavioral experiments in a web-browser.
