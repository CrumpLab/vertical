# vertical 0.0.0.9100

This version is a rethinking of vertical's back-end functionality with the goal of making vertical more lightweight and portable.

* Initialize project components from source
  * When a vertical project is created, all subcomponents are pulled from their source, instead of being hard-coded to vertical, making the package more portable, easier to maintain, and lightweight
* Select components
  * When a vertical project is created, users can choose which components to initialize.
* Now includes a poster template
* New contributor: Matti Vuorre


# vertical 0.0.0.9000
